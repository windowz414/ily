# I Love You

## What kind of repo is this?

So, I have done this little repo, which is kind of the same as [Bruh](https://github.com/windowz414/Bruh),
to be a bit spammy to spread love. Not the efficient way, but should work.

Inspired by [this reply](https://twitter.com/ThresholdBliss/status/1476524405115158528) done under [this Tweet of Felice's](https://twitter.com/Felice_Neko/status/1476497019183288322).
